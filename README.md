<h3><b> Deterministic Finite Machine Simulator</b></h3>
<h5> <i>Build and test DFAs </i> </h5>

<hr/>

<h4> Description: </h4>
<p> Finite Automata(FA) is the simplest machine to recognize patterns. DFA refers to deterministic finite automata. Deterministic refers to the uniqueness of the computation. The finite automata are called deterministic finite automata if the machine is read an input string one symbol at a time.

<p>
This is a software which lets you build DFA diagrams on a drawing area and test it with custom input strings.
